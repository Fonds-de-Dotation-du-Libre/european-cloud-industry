			"title": "Southeast Asia's Largest Bank Migrates to Open Source Database MariaDB",
			"description": "When DBS Bank first started the journey to open source with MariaDB, it took a conservative approach, testing a single non-critical application. That was a success, so DBS tested three additional applications, including a payment service module – a key component of the bank’s offerings. Those, too, were a success. The MariaDB migration continued apace, and two years into the journey DBS Bank had more than 30 applications in production running on MariaDB, including some of the most complex applications for corporate banking services. Its commercial banking and integrated payment engines went live on MariaDB in August 2017 – the first two mission-critical apps to do so. ",
