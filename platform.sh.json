Cloudnet, Pixelant’s managed hosting provider, imposed a heavy infrastructure modification process that required Pixelant to contact the provider every time they wanted to implement even minor changes; this approach significantly slowed the team’s dev workflow. Eventually, Pixelant founder Robert Lindh began to look for a more flexible solution. And he chose Platform.sh.To support its growth goals and enhance efficiencies, Pixelant adopted Platform.sh in 2018. The platform helps to streamline workflow, refocus development skills on new client features, experiences, and solutions",
