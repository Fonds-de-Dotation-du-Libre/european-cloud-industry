In the U.S., the nonprofit provides free medical air transport services to individuals who need access to specialized medical care. Running a medical transport system means that the organization has to go over sensitive medical records and comply with strict regulations when storing and sharing such data. For years, the charity had been using a paper- and faxed-based system, which wasn’t totally foolproof so it was time to look for a better solution that enables remote, secure storage of their patients’ confidential information. Tresorit’s secure cloud solution provided Wings of Hope with the secure place the charity needed to store and archive protected health information. Sharing information among its medical staff who are authorized to access a patient’s medical records has become easier and safer too, as an extra layer of protection can be added by setting up a password and an expiry date for documents, and restricting the number of downloads possible. Tresorit’s zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption also means that all data is automatically encrypted before it leaves a device. In other words, it cannot be accessed by anyone, including system administrators and the service provider itself.",
