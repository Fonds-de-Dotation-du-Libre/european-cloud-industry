      "description": "Le Wagon hosted their Ruby on Rails applications on Heroku until they encountered a limitation for their educational platform. The purpose of this application is to test the students' code to see if it is good. The application then sends a message back to the student indicating whether their code is correct or incorrect, similar to continuous integration. The tests designed by the pedagogical team worked well locally on the students' machines but did not run correctly on Heroku, in the absence of SQLIte headers on the machines offered on this PaaS. Following this problem, they turned to Scalingo to host Le Wagon's applications. The goal was to have a stable infrastructure that did not require human intervention.",

Isolation with one VPS per client and Docker to help with system administration but it wasn't enough. Between the recurring problems of builds, the sometimes forgotten backups or the lack of recovery plan pushed Robin to look for a better solution. The choice went to Heroku. Technically the experience was very satisfying but the human side was much less so. They decided to choose Scalingo the support being a real asset.",

This application was hosted on dedicated managed servers and Clément encountered problems such as communication with the outsourcing company was sub-optimal and the dedicated server that were under-utilized in no-high traffic peaks period. That's why in 2017 Clément started testing other services and his choice went to Scalingo because it offered the possibility of being hosted on a high-availability platform at the same price, with in particular multi-node clusters for Redis and PostgreSQL, which gave the technical team peace of mind and allowed them to make updates without any downtime. And also because of the reactive support that has corrected the performance problems detected during some specific scale-up tests.",

Because their business has also changed a lot they had to adapt and create new softwares continuously so they did not want to spend hours configuring servers anymore. They did not want to manage security updates by ourselves. They did not want to wait several hours / days before a simple nginx update. They wanted to be free to migrate quickly from one supplier to another if needed. In short, they wanted flexibility, scalability, performance, stability, and most importantly: they wanted to be able to focus on their real job. Scalingo was the ideal partner to help in this change process. From the beginning what were seducing was the speed with which they have been deploying new versions and new applications.",

On Scalingo, Baqio team run a staging app and a production app. If they want to do a Ruby version upgrade for example, they just have to modify a file and push it to the staging app to test its behavior. It is an incredible comfort compared to previous solution Heroku.",
